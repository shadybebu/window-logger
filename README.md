📜 About The Project
Window Logger is a command-line tool designed to help security analysts, system administrators, and students quickly identify suspicious activities from Windows Security Event Logs. Instead of manually sifting through thousands of log entries, this script automatically parses an exported XML log file, filters for predefined critical events, and displays them as clean, human-readable alerts.

This tool was created to simplify the initial stages of a security investigation by highlighting the events that matter most.

✨ Key Features

Simple & Fast: Parses large XML log files efficiently using standard Python libraries.

Critical Event Filtering: Identifies high-priority security events like failed logons, account creation, privilege escalation, and log clearing.

CLI Alerts: Presents findings in a clear, formatted, and color-coded style directly in your terminal.

Zero Dependencies: Runs with a standard Python 3 installation, no external packages needed.

Easily Customizable: The list of critical event IDs can be easily modified within the script to fit your monitoring needs.

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get the tool up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+: The script requires a modern version of Python. You can download it from python.org.

Windows Operating System: The tool is designed to parse logs generated by Windows.

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/shadybebu/window-logger.git]

Navigate to the project directory:

cd window-logger

Alternatively, you can just download the window_logger.py file directly.

💻 Usage
Using the tool involves two main steps: exporting the logs from Windows and then running the script.

1. Export Windows Event Logs to XML
Before running the script, you need a log file to analyze.

Open Event Viewer on Windows (Press Win + R, type eventvwr.msc, and hit Enter).

In the left pane, navigate to Windows Logs > Security.

Right-click on Security and select Save All Events As....

In the save dialog, choose a location, enter a file name (e.g., SecurityLog.xml), and most importantly, select XML (XML File) from the "Save as type" dropdown.

Click Save.

2. Run the Script
Execute the script from your terminal, providing the path to your exported .xml file as the only argument.

Syntax:

python window_logger.py <path_to_your_log_file.xml>

Example:

# If the file is in the same folder
python window_logger.py SecurityLog.xml

# If the file is elsewhere on your system (use quotes if the path has spaces)
python window_logger.py "C:\Users\Your Name\Desktop\Security Events.xml"

Example Output
If suspicious events are found, the output will look like this:

🔧 Customization
You can easily customize which events the script flags as "critical."

Open window_logger.py in a text editor.

Find the CRITICAL_EVENT_IDS dictionary near the top of the file.

Add, remove, or modify the Event IDs and their descriptions to suit your needs.

# --- Configuration: Critical Event IDs and their descriptions ---
CRITICAL_EVENT_IDS = {
    '4625': 'Failed Logon: An account failed to log on (potential brute-force).',
    '4720': 'User Account Created: A new user account was created.',
    '1102': 'Audit Log Cleared: The Security audit log was cleared.',
    # Add your custom Event ID here
    '4798': 'A user\'s local group membership was enumerated.',
}
