# 🛡️ Window Logger 🛡️

A lightweight, zero-dependency command-line tool for quickly parsing and analyzing Windows Security Event Logs.

---

## 📜 About The Project

In cybersecurity, time is critical. Sifting through thousands of Windows Event Logs to find a single suspicious entry can be a daunting and time-consuming task. **Window Logger** was built to solve this problem.

This tool automates the initial steps of a security investigation by parsing an exported XML log file and flagging only the high-priority events that matter most. It's designed for cybersecurity students, security analysts, and system administrators who need a quick and efficient way to spot potential threats.

## ✨ Key Features

* ⚡ **Simple & Fast**: Efficiently parses large XML log files using standard Python libraries.
* 🎯 **Critical Event Filtering**: Automatically identifies high-priority security events like failed logons, account creation, privilege escalation, and log clearing.
* 🖥️ **Clear CLI Alerts**: Presents findings in a clean, color-coded, and human-readable format directly in your terminal.
* 📦 **Zero Dependencies**: Runs with a standard Python 3 installation. No external packages are needed.
* 🔧 **Easily Customizable**: The list of critical event IDs can be easily modified within the script to fit your specific monitoring needs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get the tool up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.7+**: The script requires a modern version of Python. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **Windows OS**: The tool is designed to parse logs generated by Windows.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shadybebu/window-logger.git](https://github.com/shadybebu/window-logger.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd window-logger
    ```

## 💻 How to Use

Using the tool involves two main steps: exporting the logs from Windows and then running the script.

### 1. Export Windows Event Logs to XML

Before running the script, you need a log file to analyze.

1.  Open **Event Viewer** on Windows (Press `Win + R`, type `eventvwr.msc`, and hit Enter).
2.  In the left pane, navigate to **Windows Logs > Security**.
3.  Right-click on **Security** and select **"Save All Events As..."**.
4.  Choose a location, enter a file name (e.g., `SecurityLog.xml`), and most importantly, select **XML (XML File)** from the "Save as type" dropdown.
5.  Click **Save**.

### 2. Run the Script

Execute the script from your terminal, providing the path to your exported `.xml` file as an argument.

**Syntax:**
```bash
python window_logger.py <path_to_your_log_file.xml>
```
If suspicious events are found, the output will look like this:
```bash

# 🔧 Customization
You can easily customize which events the script flags as "critical."

Open window_logger.py in a text editor.

Find the CRITICAL_EVENT_IDS dictionary near the top of the file.

Add, remove, or modify the Event IDs and their descriptions to suit your needs.

Python

 --- Configuration: Critical Event IDs and their descriptions ---
```bash
CRITICAL_EVENT_IDS = {
    '4625': 'Failed Logon: An account failed to log on (potential brute-force).',
    '4720': 'User Account Created: A new user account was created.',
    '1102': 'Audit Log Cleared: The Security audit log was cleared.',
    '4798': "A user's local group membership was enumerated.",
      Add your custom Event ID here
